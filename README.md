# bribe
bribes nodes to pin files

Suppose that you want to ensure that pinning is highly decentralized and done in several currencies, so that you can pay for pins in whatever currency, but you don't want too-too many transactions and you're not aiming at trustlessness.  

You bring in an intermediary to pay bribes, of course.
